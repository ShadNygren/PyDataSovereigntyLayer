# Data Sovereignty Layer
The Data Sovereignty Layer ensures privacy and compliance with regulations, encompassing encryption, access control, and compliance monitoring. It safeguards user data and adheres to regulatory requirements.

# Understanding Data Sovereignty
"Data Sovereignty" in PAI architecture refers to ensuring that data about an individual is subject to the laws of their jurisdiction, safeguarding privacy and regulatory compliance.

# Protocols Involved
- Encryption Protocols: Secure data in transit and at rest.
- Data Localization: Store data within legal jurisdictions.
- Access Control: Regulate user permissions.
- Data Transfer: Secure data exchange between systems.
- Audit Trails: Monitor data access and usage.

# Major Use Cases
- Data Sovereignty Management
- Third-party Data Processing
- Data Access from Different Jurisdictions
- 00000000000000000000000000000000
- User Data Localization: Store data as per regional laws.
- Data Encryption: Safeguard data confidentiality.
- Access Control: Regulate data access.
- Compliance Monitoring: Ensure adherence to regulations.

# BDD with Gherkin Feature Files
- Gherkin feature files outline behaviors and scenarios related to Data Sovereignty, facilitating clear communication and understanding of intended functionalities.
- The Behave framework is used for BDD

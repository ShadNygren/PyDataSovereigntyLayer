Feature: Data Sovereignty Management

  In order to ensure user privacy and compliance with data protection regulations
  As a PAI system administrator
  I want to manage data sovereignty measures effectively

  Scenario: User specifies data storage location preference
    Given a user wants to configure data storage preferences
    When the user selects preferred storage locations in the settings
    Then the system ensures user data is stored only in the specified locations

  Scenario: Data encryption for user privacy
    Given sensitive user data is being stored in the system
    When the data is encrypted using AES encryption
    Then the system ensures data confidentiality and integrity are maintained

  Scenario: Access control for data protection
    Given multiple user roles with different data access privileges
    When users attempt to access data based on their roles
    Then the system grants or denies access accordingly

  Scenario: Compliance audit for data sovereignty
    Given periodic compliance audits are scheduled
    When the system conducts audits on data handling processes
    Then the system verifies adherence to data protection regulations
